"""
Task: 
Write a program that shows a window with 3 buttons
When each is pressed, a different png image should be shown in the center of the window.
Three images are provided (but they need to be prepared for showing: the earth, moon, and sun images)
Lastly, there should be one extra button that, when clicked, should ask the user (using the console) whether to a) continue, or b) exit the program.
If the user inputs "a" , then we continue; if they input "b", a "Goodbye" message is printed and then the window and program end.


Things to solve:
1) the logic for the code (PLAN before running)
2) setting up the images; They are not all png images and they are not all of the right size; Use the following link to convert them to png images of a size: 300 by 300 pixels.
